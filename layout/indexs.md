# Why Blog
## Understanding of Blogging
People who like to write blogs will go through three stages.
>First stage: When first encountering blogs, finding them fresh and exciting, trying to write on a free platform.

>Second stage: Discovering the limitations of free platforms, purchasing own domain and hosting to build an independent blog.

>Third stage: Finding independent blog management too troublesome, preferring to let others manage while retaining control, focusing only on writing articles.
 
We are generating more and more data online. This information represents our digital footprint on the internet and deserves our serious attention. However, it is scattered across various websites. Often it's difficult to aggregate them together, and we can't freely control how information is arranged on different sites. Therefore, we need a space we can truly control - a blog.

Through blogs, we can record our life journey and growth trajectory. Unlike Twitter's fragmented nature or Facebook's relationship-focused approach, it's a personal space.
